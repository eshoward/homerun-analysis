# Home Runs per Ballpark Analysis

This is an initial analysis into Home Runs that were hit between the 2015 season
and April 9, 2023. In collaboration with [Julian Coleman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliantcoleman/)
and [Annabel Judd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabel-judd-681004156/). Data
was collected from Baseball Savant. 

Julian originally proposed this idea to look at Home Runs that were hit in all
ballparks. Our hope in looking at this data is to be able to find what might 
cause home runs to be hit that are outside of the strike zone. What causes this?
Do certain ball parks have more of these types of home runs than others? What pitches
have the most home runs that are outside the strike zone? In answering these 
questions we would like to then analyze certain players who may be free agents next
year whose home runs may play better at certain parks.
